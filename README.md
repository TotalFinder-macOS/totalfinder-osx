## What is TotalFinder?

TotalFinder is a powerful enhancement for the Finder application that transforms file and folder management by providing advanced tools for navigation, organization, and productivity. It is designed for developers, designers, power users, and anyone who requires more control over their files than the native system allows.  

This application introduces tabbed browsing, allowing multiple folders to be opened in a single window for quick switching, reducing clutter from multiple Finder windows. The dual-pane mode enables side-by-side folder comparisons, drag-and-drop file transfers, and multi-folder operations, streamlining workflows for complex projects, large datasets, and intensive file management tasks.  

TotalFinder goes beyond interface enhancements by adding a suite of productivity features. Users can perform cut & paste operations, merge folders safely without losing content, sort files using custom criteria, and access a wide range of keyboard shortcuts. These improvements help minimize repetitive tasks, reduce errors, and accelerate organization, making it ideal for both individual and team environments.  

Designed to work with the latest Apple processors (M1, M2, M3, M4) and modern system updates, TotalFinder combines new capabilities with system stability. Developers can navigate project directories quickly, designers can manage assets efficiently, and content creators can handle extensive libraries with ease.  

Other advanced features include color-coded tags, customizable folder views, smart sorting, and retention of all original Finder functions while adding layers of enhanced control. Automation and scripting support allow repeatable workflows, boosting productivity further.  

In short, TotalFinder is not just a Finder upgradeâ€”it is a complete file management solution that empowers users to handle directories and files with unprecedented efficiency. It balances simplicity with advanced functionality, suitable for casual users and professional workflows alike. Whether managing code, creative assets, or business documents, TotalFinder improves organization, speed, and control.
